Issues:
- admin update user not working

- e.target.reset not working in createuserform and mydetails
- implement refresh on form submit (my details, user mgmt)
- implement re-render on form submit (same implementation as above?)

minor:
- there is an issue with header at login page: when doing the process of verifying, it gets an axios error

Todo:

frontend
- double check if our constant login state check is working
- protect routes

- Implement check on state chage(or re-render?) for jwt, do logout if no valid jwt //done?
- Implement groups/permissions check on state change in case permissions are revoked
- Implement checkGroup route for frontend to call so u can checkgroup at any time

backend
- re-implement verify groups in authController
