A3:

Must justify why I'm using param / payload for each item

Name
Method - read up on why we use the http method
Parameters - URL paremeters (or request body)


Issues:

- on run old/expired jwt is not auto deleted in some cases, need to do a check and delete

- e.target.reset not working in createuserform and mydetails
- implement re-render on form submit (same implementation as above?)
- Edit details - field state is resetting properly after submit, but the field itself is not being cleared. Clicking save again directly after submitting will submit 2 blank fields even though the textfields are not empty

minor:
- non-logged in header attempts to do a verifyAccessGroup and catches axios error 403 (forbidden)

frontend:
- EditRow warning: "MUI: The value provided to Autocomplete is invalid.
None of the options match with `""`." - seems to be fixed for now?

Todo:

frontend

- add jwt checks to some/all(?) frontend routes:

if (response.data === "jwt_error") {
            appDispatch({ type: "errorMessage", value: "Token invalid." })
            appDispatch({ type: "logout" })
            navigate("/")
          }
          
- double check if our constant login state check is working
- error handling based on appDispatch (logout, )
- protect routes

- Implement check on state change(or re-render?) for jwt, do logout if no valid jwt //done?
- Implement groups/permissions check on state change in case permissions are revoked

backend
- what is the process for authenticating access to certain routes based on group?
- some sort of function to auto create admin acc rather than "manually" setting it up

other
- figure out how to run frontend server without npm start
- have composite key for necessary table in db 
- is token check still needed in every backend route? (since I already have it under checkJWT)
