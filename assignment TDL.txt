Issues:
- admin update user not working
- on run old/expired jwt is not checked, need to do a check and delete

- e.target.reset not working in createuserform and mydetails
- implement refresh on form submit (my details, user mgmt)
- implement re-render on form submit (same implementation as above?)
- Edit details - field state is resetting properly after submit, but the field itself is not being cleared. Clicking save again directly after submitting will submit 2 blank fields even though the textfields are not empty
- Admin create user: If no groups specified, there will always be a blank group


minor:
- non-logged in header attempts to do a verifyAccessGroup and thus returns axios error 403 (forbidden)

frontend:
- EditRow warning: "MUI: The value provided to Autocomplete is invalid.
None of the options match with `""`."

Todo:

frontend
- change UI colours to something brighter for presentation

- double check if our constant login state check is working
- protect routes

- Implement check on state chage(or re-render?) for jwt, do logout if no valid jwt //done?
- Implement groups/permissions check on state change in case permissions are revoked
- Implement checkGroup route for frontend to call so u can checkgroup at any time

backend
- some sort of function to auto create admin acc rather than "manually" setting it up

VScode Extensions to get
